# **Electron Backscatter in Energetic Particle Precipitation: Data Analysis and Simulation**
#### Julia Claxton (she/they) || julia.claxton@colorado.edu

This repository contains the code and data necessary to replicate the analysis, results, and figures from the paper *"Electron Backscatter in Energetic Particle Precipitation: Data Analysis and Simulation"* submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research.

The manuscript for the paper may be found at `/paper/output/claxton_2025_backscatter.pdf` in this repository. The supporting information document can be found at `/paper/output/supporting_information.pdf`

A file containing precipitation and backscatter data for the ELFIN lifetime subject to our data selection procedure outlined in the paper can be found at `/data/ELFIN_backscatter_and_simulation.csv`. This file also contains our modelling scheme's backscatter predictions. Those rows can be safely ignored if using that data for another purpose.
