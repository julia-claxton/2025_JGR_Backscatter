  abstract={The Electron Loss and Fields Investigation with a Spatio-Temporal Ambiguity-Resolving option (ELFIN-STAR, or heretoforth simply: ELFIN) mission comprises two identical 3-Unit (3U) CubeSats on a polar (∼93∘ inclination), nearly circular, low-Earth (∼450 km altitude) orbit. Launched on September 15, 2018, ELFIN is expected to have a >2.5 year lifetime. Its primary science objective is to resolve the mechanism of storm-time relativistic electron precipitation, for which electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a prime candidate. From its ionospheric vantage point, ELFIN uses its unique pitch-angle-resolving capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit period of a single low-altitude satellite (Torbit ∼ 90 min). Each satellite carries an energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50 keV to 5 MeV electrons with {\$}{\backslash}Delta {\$}E/E < 40{\%} and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a ∼72 cm boom that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to 5 Hz Nyquist (nominally) with <0.3 nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1 Hz. The spinning satellites (Tspin{\$}{\backslash},{\backslash}sim {\$}3 s) are equipped with magnetorquers (air coils) that permit spin-up or -down and reorientation maneuvers. Using those, the spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane (nominally), allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250 keV -- 5 MeV ions, addressing secondary science. Funded initially by CalSpace and the University Nanosat Program, ELFIN was selected for flight with joint support from NSF and NASA between 2014 and 2018 and launched by the ELaNa XVIII program on a Delta II rocket (with IceSatII as the primary). Mission operations are currently funded by NASA. Working under experienced UCLA mentors, with advice from The Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel, more than 250 undergraduates have matured the ELFIN implementation strategy; developed the instruments, satellite, and ground systems and operate the two satellites. ELFIN's already high potential for cutting-edge science return is compounded by concurrent equatorial Heliophysics missions (THEMIS, Arase, Van Allen Probes, MMS) and ground stations. ELFIN's integrated data analysis approach, rapid dissemination strategies via the SPace Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), and data coordination with the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO) optimize science yield, enabling the widest community benefits. Several storm-time events have already been captured and are presented herein to demonstrate ELFIN's data analysis methods and potential. These form the basis of on-going studies to resolve the primary mission science objective. Broad energy precipitation events, precipitation bands, and microbursts, clearly seen both at dawn and dusk, extend from tens of keV to >1 MeV. This broad energy range of precipitation indicates that multiple waves are providing scattering concurrently. Many observed events show significant backscattered fluxes, which in the past were hard to resolve by equatorial spacecraft or non-pitch-angle-resolving ionospheric missions. These observations suggest that the ionosphere plays a significant role in modifying magnetospheric electron fluxes and wave-particle interactions. Routine data captures starting in February 2020 and lasting for at least another year, approximately the remainder of the mission lifetime, are expected to provide a very rich dataset to address questions even beyond the primary mission science objective.},

  abstract = {Abstract Quantifying radiation belt precipitation and its consequent atmospheric effects requires an accurate assessment of the pitch angle distribution of precipitating electrons, as well as knowledge of the dependence of the atmospheric deposition on that distribution. Here Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the effects of the incident electron energy and pitch angle on precipitation for bounce period time scales, and the implications for both the loss from the radiation belts and the deposition in the upper atmosphere. Simulations are conducted at discrete energies and pitch angles to assess the dependence on these parameters of the atmospheric energy deposition profiles and to estimate the backscattered particle distributions. We observe that the atmospheric response is both energy and pitch angle dependent. These effects together result in an energy-dependent bounce loss cone angle, which can vary by 2–3° with particle energy when considered at low-Earth orbit. This modeling also predicts that a significant fraction of the input electron distribution will be backscattered and should be observable by low-Earth-orbiting satellites as field-aligned beams emerging from the atmosphere at energies lower than the input distribution and having pitch angles distributed just inside the loss cone.},

The atmospheric response, namely excess ionization in the upper and middle atmosphere, together with bremsstrahlung X-ray production, is calculated with kinetic particle simulations using the Geant4 Monte Carlo framework. Mono-energy and mono-pitch angle electron beams are simulated and combined using a Green's function approach to represent realistic electron spectra and pitch angle distributions. Results from this model include more accurate ionization profiles than previous analytical models, deeper photon penetration into the atmosphere than previous Monte Carlo model predictions, and predictions of backscatter fractions of loss cone electrons up to 40\%. The model results are verified by comparison with previous precipitation modeling results, and validated using balloon X-ray measurements from the Balloon Array for RBSP Relativistic Electron Losses mission and backscattered electron energy and pitch angle measurements from the Electron Loss and Fields Investigation with a Spatio-Temporal Ambiguity-Resolving CubeSat mission. The model results and solution techniques are developed into a Python package for public use.},

  abstract = {The precipitation of electrons with energy Ee ≥ 40 kev into the atmosphere over North America is analyzed. Measurements were made principally with three directional Geiger tubes on the magnetically oriented satellite Injun 3. It is shown that the intensity of electrons mirroring at the satellite altitude increases rather than decreases when precipitation occurs, for example, over an aurora. The precipitation process is such that the angular distribution of electrons tends to approach isotropy over the upper hemisphere at the satellite altitude. The flux of electrons with Ee ≥ 40 kev backscattered by the atmosphere is about ten per cent of the precipitated flux. No events have been found where the upflux exceeded the downflux, and it is concluded that most acceleration processes take place high above the satellite, accelerating electrons preferentially parallel to the magnetic field lines. It is shown that electrons with Ee ≥ 1 Mev trapped around L ∼ 4 are not perturbed when electrons with Ee ≳ 40 kev are precipitated at the same place, and so it is considered that the precipitation is not caused just by a gross change in the magnetic field producing lowered mirror points. The dependence of precipitation on Kp, local and real time, L, and so on is summarized and the implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {The time-averaged intensity of electrons with energy (E)≳40 kev has been measured with Explorer 12 to be of the order of 107 particles (cm2 sec)−1 between equatorial radial distances (L) of ∼2 and ∼10 earth radii. The outflux of these electrons has been measured with the State University of Iowa satellite Injun 1 at 1000-km altitude over North America. The average intensity varied from ∼103 particles (cm2 sec)−1 at invariant latitude (Λ) ∼45° to ∼105 particles (cm2 sec)−1 in the auroral zone and then fell off very rapidly at higher latitudes. Accordingly, if the source of the electrons was stopped, but the outflux continued at the same rate, the outer zone beyond L ≳2 would drain empty of electrons in a few hours. Requirements that the source or acceleration mechanism must satisfy are specified. The neutron-albedo source is of the order of 100 million times too weak to satisfy one of these requirements. The latitude profile of electron outflux is remarkably similar to the profile of the frequency of occurrence of auroras. It is suggested that the ‘leaky bucket’ model of the outer-zone electrons be replaced by a ‘splash catcher’ model, although this is undoubtedly an oversimplified model. The excitation of the 5577 A emission in night airglow by electrons as in weak auroras is discussed. The outflux of electrons with E≥40 kev is far too weak to excite all this emission, and it is shown that the outflux of electrons with E≥1 kev is probably too weak also. It is concluded, therefore, that the dominant part of 5577 A nightglow emission over North America is not phenomenologically the same as a weak and permanent aurora. This conclusion rests on the assumption that the electron energy spectrum between 1 and ∼100 kev is essentially independent of pitch angle at 1000-km altitude; this assumption is discussed.},

The integral electron energy spectrum could be represented by exp (−E/22 kev) at energies above 30 kev. The angular distribution of the incident electrons was approximately isotropic over the upper hemisphere. Two other types of angular distributions, involving large intensities of upward-moving particles, were observed. The measured electron flux was sufficient to account for the observed radio absorption.Protons in the energy range greater than 500 kev were recorded with a maximum intensity of 6 × 102 particles cm−2 sec−1 sterad−1. The proton intensity was relatively steady and was not correlated with the electron flux either in space or in time. Most of the protons appeared to enter the atmosphere to the south of Fort Churchill. }

  abstract = {A new computational model has been created to describe the interaction of auroral electrons with the atmosphere. For electrons of energy greater than 500 eV, continuous energy losses and small angle deflections are combined in a Fokker-Planck diffusion equation that computes energy spectrums over all pitch angles throughout the atmosphere. These fluxes are then used to determine the rates of secondary electron and degraded (E < 500 eV) primary electron production at all heights. This information is used to compute upward and downward hemispherical fluxes in the energy range 0–500 eV, taking into account discrete energy losses, large angle scattering, and particle transport along magnetic field lines. The model has been used to compute energy spectrums, ionization rates, backscatter ratios, and optical emissions associated with different incident electron spectrums. For monoenergetic electrons of energy 2 keV and above the results obtained agree well with the work of Rees (1969) and Rees and Maeda (1973). At lower energies the effects of transport and elastic collisions become progressively more important, and the present results differ significantly both from the Rees and Maeda results and from those obtained from the ideas of energy degradation. Finally, spectrums typical of the nighttime auroral oval and daytime polar cusp are used to obtain the altitude dependent fluxes, ionization rates, and optical emissions.},

  abstract={Relativistic electron precipitation (REP) from the Earth's radiation belt plays an important role in mesospheric ozone loss as a connection between space weather and the climate system. However, the rapid (tens of minutes) destruction of mesospheric ozone directly caused by REP has remained poorly understood due to the difficulty of recognizing its location and duration. Here we show a compelling rapid correspondence between localized REP and ozone destruction during a specific auroral phenomenon, the called an isolated proton aurora (IPA). The IPA from the Earth's radiation belt becomes an important spatial and temporal proxy of REP, distinct from other auroral phenomena, and allowing visualizing micro-ozone holes. We found ozone destruction of as much as 10--60{\%} within 1.5 h of the initiation of IPA. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves in the oxygen ion band observed as the driver of REP likely affect through resonance with mainly ultra-relativistic (>{\thinspace}2 mega-electron-volts) energy electrons. The rapid REP impact demonstrates its crucial role and direct effect on regulating the atmospheric chemical balance.},

The spin-stabilized CubeSats (spin-rate: 21 RPM) produced high-resolution measurements of precipitating, trapped, and backscattered fluxes of electrons and ions in the radiation belts. Launched in September 2018, ELFIN operated successfully until its deorbit just over four years later. Initially, however, mission operations was very challenging and only tapped the full mission potential after a thorough redesign of the operations paradigm. This mid-mission adjustment yielded the higher data downlink volume necessary to acquire a comprehensive data set, therefore enabling ensemble studies with sufficient statistical significance. The new operational framework also led to additional improvements across the mission. Most notably, the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) benefited from more reliable collections of magnetometer data for attitude determination, enabling knowledge and control to <1°. This allowed high pitch-angle resolution (especially within the loss cone) and high energy resolution spectrograms, both powerful diagnostics of radiation belt electron and ion precipitation. This paper highlights the scientific advancements made possible by ELFIN’s efficient mission operations and ADCS design, unique for CubeSats, and emphasizes the role of electron precipitation measurements for future studies in magnetospheric, ionospheric, and atmospheric physics.}

Electron precipitation mainly occurs on localized radial scales (∼0.3 L), over 15–24 MLT and 5–8 L shells, stronger at ∼MeV energies and weaker down to ∼100–200 keV. Additionally, the observed loss cone pitch-angle distribution agrees with quasilinear predictions at ≳250 keV (more filled loss cone with increasing energy), while additional mechanisms are needed to explain the observed low-energy precipitation.},

  abstract={Precipitation of energetic particles into the atmosphere greatly disturbs the chemical composition from the upper stratosphere to the lower thermosphere. Most important are changes to the budget of atmospheric nitric oxides (NOx = N, NO, NO2) and to atmospheric reactive hydrogen oxides (HOx = H, OH, HO2), which both contribute to ozone loss in the stratosphere and mesosphere. The impact of energetic particle precipitation on the chemical composition of the atmosphere has been studied since the 1960s, and there are a number of observations as well as model studies concerning especially the auroral impact and large solar particle events. Changes to the NOx budget due to energetic particle precipitation can be quite long-lived during polar winter and can then be transported down into the lower mesosphere and stratosphere, where NOx is one of the main participants in catalytic ozone destruction. Energetic particle precipitation can also affect temperatures and dynamics of the atmosphere from the source region down to the stratosphere and possibly even down to the surface, due to a coupling of chemical composition changes affecting atmospheric heating and cooling rates, the mean circulation, and wave propagation and breaking. Thus, energetic particle precipitation impacts have been implemented in chemistry-climate models reaching from the surface up to the mesosphere or lower thermosphere. However, there are still a number of open questions in the theoretical description of the energetic particle precipitation impact; the most important are uncertainties in the formation rate of different NOx species due to energetic particle precipitation, and the complex coupling between chemical changes, atmospheric heating and cooling rates, and atmospheric dynamics.},

Multi-satellite data analysis is used to examine the temporal evolution of the enhancements, to place them in historical context, and to investigate their origin. The enhancements were a factor of 4 higher than nominal at some locations, and are unprecedented in the northern hemisphere since at least 1985. They were accompanied by reductions in O3 of more than 60\% in some cases. The analysis suggests that energetic particle precipitation led to substantial NOx production in the upper atmosphere beginning with the remarkable solar storms in late October 2003 and possibly persisting through January. Downward transport of the excess NOx, facilitated by unique meteorological conditions in 2004 that led to an unusually strong upper stratospheric vortex from late January through March, caused the enhancements.},

The obtained data set provides a unique climatological record of NOy in the middle atmosphere. The contribution of NOy produced by energetic particle precipitation (EPP) has been discriminated from that produced by N2O oxidation using a tracer correlation method based on MIPAS CH4 and CO observations. The EPP-NOy distributions, obtained in the vertical range 20–70km, allow to trace odd nitrogen polar winter descent from the mesosphere down to the middle and lower stratosphere, where it contributes to catalytic ozone destruction. Highest EPP-NOy concentrations (up to 1 ppmv) are found in the winter solstice mesosphere, decreasing continuously with time and toward lower altitudes. Springtime peak concentrations of a few parts per billion by volume are observed at 22–25km, demonstrating a regular EPP impact on the entire stratosphere. The interannual variation shows a clear solar cycle signal in consonance with geomagnetic activity variations. A pronounced hemispheric asymmetry of EPP-NOy is observed, with higher concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and stronger variability in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Poleward of 60°, EPP-NOy contributes to the winter NOy column at 20–70km by 10–40\% in the SH and 1–30\% in the NH. Smaller contributions (0.1–1\%) are found at midlatitudes (30°–60°). This study provides the first assessment of EPP-NOy intrusions into the stratosphere based on globally available satellite data on a decadal scale.},

  abstract = {Abstract Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can drive precipitation of tens of keV protons and relativistic electrons, and are a potential candidate for causing radiation belt flux dropouts. In this study, we quantitatively analyze three cases of EMIC-driven precipitation, which occurred near the dusk sector observed by multiple Low-Earth-Orbiting (LEO) Polar Operational Environmental Satellites/Meteorological Operational satellite programme (POES/MetOp) satellites. During EMIC wave activity, the proton precipitation occurred from few tens of keV up to hundreds of keV, while the electron precipitation was mainly at relativistic energies. We compare observations of electron precipitation with calculations using quasi-linear theory. For all cases, we consider the effects of other magnetospheric waves observed simultaneously with EMIC waves, namely, plasmaspheric hiss and magnetosonic waves, and find that the electron precipitation at MeV energies was predominantly caused by EMIC-driven pitch angle scattering. Interestingly, each precipitation event observed by a LEO satellite extended over a limited L shell region (ΔL ~ 0.3 on average), suggesting that the pitch angle scattering caused by EMIC waves occurs only when favorable conditions are met, likely in a localized region. Furthermore, we take advantage of the LEO constellation to explore the occurrence of precipitation at different L shells and magnetic local time sectors, simultaneously with EMIC wave observations near the equator (detected by Van Allen Probes) or at the ground (measured by magnetometers). Our analysis shows that although EMIC waves drove precipitation only in a narrow ΔL, electron precipitation was triggered at various locations as identified by POES/MetOp over a rather broad region (up to ~4.4 hr MLT and ~1.4 L shells) with similar patterns between satellites.},

The resonant energy is generally well above 1 Mev throughout the magnetosphere, but it can fall to near 1 Mev just within the plasmapause. This also corresponds to the region where ring current (10–50 kev) protons are expected to be strongly unstable. The resulting ion-cyclotron wave amplitude necessary to precipitate ring current protons leads to electron lifetimes near the strong diffusion limit. Thus, >1-Mev electrons whose drift orbits intersect the stormtime plasmapause should rapidly be precipitated in the region 3<L<5 during the initial phase of a magnetic storm.},

This work describes WACCM6 and some of the important features of the model. WACCM6 can reproduce many modes of variability and trends in the middle atmosphere, including the quasi-biennial oscillation, stratospheric sudden warmings, and the evolution of Southern Hemisphere springtime ozone depletion over the twentieth century. WACCM6 can also reproduce the climate and temperature trends of the 20th century throughout the atmospheric column. The representation of the climate has improved in WACCM6, relative to WACCM4. In addition, there are improvements in high-latitude climate variability at the surface and sea ice extent in WACCM6 over the lower top version of the model (CAM6) that comes from the extended vertical domain and expanded aerosol chemistry in WACCM6, highlighting the importance of the stratosphere and tropospheric chemistry for high-latitude climate variability.},

  abstract = {An interpretation of the stable trapping boundaries of energetic electrons and protons during quiet periods is given basing on a realistic magnetospheric magnetic field model. Particle losses are explained in terms of an ionospheric and drift loss cone filling due to a non-adiabatic pitch-angle scattering in the nightside magnetotail current sheet. The proposed mechanism is shown to provide a good agreement of the observed and calculated positions of the energetic particle trapping boundaries, as well as their energy dependence. The obtained results can be applied as a tool for investigating the magnetospheric magnetic field structure using the particle data of low-altitude satellites.}

  abstract = {Abstract Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) will evaluate the degree of correlation between two multivariate data sets and will uncover patterns of correlation between the two data sets. Here CCA is applied to the multivariate solar wind data set and the multivariate geomagnetic index data set. CCA creates a new set of solar wind variables and a new set of Earth variables. The first of the new solar wind variables can be used as a solar wind driver function for the magnetosphere; the conjugate Earth variable can be used as an Earth vector to describe global geomagnetic activity in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The CCA-generated driver functions are found to be superior in accuracy to other driver functions in the literature. CCA of the combined data sets provides information about (1) differences in the solar wind driving of high-latitude geomagnetic indices (AE, AU, AL, and polar cap index) versus magnetospheric-convection geomagnetic indices (Kp and midnight boundary index), (2) the properties of electric field-based driver functions versus reconnection-based driver functions, and (3) improvements to solar wind/magnetosphere correlations produced by time averaging the solar wind clock angle. The CCA process tends to focus on the magnetospheric-convective indices over other indices: this may indicate that there is more predictable variance in the global-convective indices than in the others.},

  abstract = {Abstract The influence of solar variability on the polar atmosphere and climate due to energetic electron precipitation (EEP) has remained an open question largely due to lack of a long-term EEP forcing data set that could be used in chemistry-climate models. Motivated by this, we have developed a model for 30–1000 keV radiation belt driven EEP. The model is based on precipitation data from low Earth orbiting POES satellites in the period 2002–2012 and empirically described plasmasphere structure, which are both scaled to a geomagnetic index. This geomagnetic index is the only input of the model and can be either Dst or Ap. Because of this, the model can be used to calculate the energy-flux spectrum of precipitating electrons from 1957 (Dst) or 1932 (Ap) onward, with a time resolution of 1 day. Results from the model compare well with EEP observations over the period of 2002–2012. Using the model avoids the challenges found in measured data sets concerning proton contamination. As demonstrated, the model results can be used to produce the first ever >80 year long atmospheric ionization rate data set for radiation belt EEP. The impact of precipitation in this energy range is mainly seen at altitudes 70–110 km. The ionization rate data set, which is available for the scientific community, will enable simulations of EEP impacts on the atmosphere and climate with realistic EEP variability. Due to limitations in this first version of the model, the results most likely represent an underestimation of the total EEP effect.},

Measurements made by the medium energy proton and electron detector (MEPED) instruments onboard both the Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites and the European Space Agency Meteorological Operational satellites are used to create global maps of precipitating electron fluxes. Unlike most previous data sets, the electron fluxes are computed using both the 0° and 90° MEPED detectors. Conversion of observed, broadband electron count rates to differential spectral fluxes uses a linear combination of analytical functions instead of a single function. Two dimensional maps of electron spectral flux are created using Delaunay triangulation to account for the relatively sparse nature of the MEPED sampling. This improves on previous studies that use a 1D interpolation over magnetic local time or L-shell zonal averaging of the MEPED data. A Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) simulation of the southern hemisphere 2003 winter using the new precipitating electron data set is shown to agree more closely with observations of odd nitrogen than WACCM simulations using other MEPED-based electron data sets. Simulated EEP-induced odd nitrogen increases led to ozone losses of more than 15\% in the polar stratosphere near 10 hPa in September of 2003.},

  abstract = {Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a DNN, called BirdNET, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286 h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670 h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four eBird hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short FFT window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, BirdNET achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4 years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, BirdNET and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.}

Numerous time-critical conservation needs may benefit from these methods. We developed and empirically studied a variety of deep neural networks to detect the vocalizations of endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). We compared the performance of these deep architectures to that of traditional detection algorithms for the primary vocalization produced by this species, the upcall. We show that deep-learning architectures are capable of producing false-positive rates that are orders of magnitude lower than alternative algorithms while substantially increasing the ability to detect calls. We demonstrate that a deep neural network trained with recordings from a single geographic region recorded over a span of days is capable of generalizing well to data from multiple years and across the species' range, and that the low false positives make the output of the algorithm amenable to quality control for verification. The deep neural networks we developed are relatively easy to implement with existing software, and may provide new insights applicable to the conservation of endangered species.},

We compared the species identification of BirdNET against expert identification using an acoustic dataset consisting of 930 minutes of recordings collected in Munich, Germany. The performance of BirdNET was evaluated using three performance metrics: precision, recall, and F1-score. The metrics were calculated using 24 combinations of the parameters week, sensitivity, and overlap at four temporal aggregations, to also test the effects of recording length. We found that BirdNET closely matched expert identification, particularly when given more data (higher temporal aggregation) and when including the parameters week of the year, a suitable sensitivity, and an overlap of one to two seconds. Thus, our study shows that BirdNET can provide species lists and richness comparable to that of expert ornithologists in acoustic surveys in urban environments. We provide a set of recommendations and parameter settings for BirdNET.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

At present, in the solar wind-magnetosphere system, most studies focus on the linear relationships analyzed by the correlation coefficient. However, transfer entropy can provide powerful model-free directed statistics, which can be used to analyze non-linear relationships that cannot be detected by traditional correlation analysis and model hypothesis. The hourly resolution data of solar activity cycle 23 and 24 were used to analyze the large time scale. The information transmission of solar wind and geomagnetic has a bimodal distribution, which is consistent with the solar activity level. Using the minute resolution data of 93 geomagnetic storms from 2010 to 2018 for small time scale analysis, the results show that E, IMFBz have strong information transmission to the geomagnetic Sym-H parameter when the time delay is 60 minutes, while vsw, Tsw, Dsw, B, Psw are lower. It provides the basis for parameter selection and prediction range determination for solar wind-geomagnetic model construction.},

  abstract = {The relativistic electron population at MeV energy in the Earth’s outer radiation belt at geostationary (GOE) orbit largely varies in association with solar wind disturbances. Although more researches have been done to understand the influence of different mechanisms that cause the variations in the relativistic electron flux in the region, but still the underlying physics is often complex and unclear. The present study uses relativistic electron (E>2MeV) fluxes data of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) geosynchronous satellites to understand the variations and its relationship with the driving parameters. The study examines the relativistic electron fluxes variations associated with the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind parameters using daily averaged data from 01 January 1990 to 31 December 2018. The results indicated that the information transfer from solar wind and IMF parameters into relativistic electrons flux is dependent on the kind of driving parameter. The result identifies the rank of driving parameters based on their maximum values in the cross correlation and information transfer analysis. Thus, AE index and vsw are the dominant driving parameters for the dynamics of relativistic electrons flux at GEO orbit. The peak values of coefficient (correlation coefficients, mutual information and entropy transfer) are observed at similar lag times (τpeak). For instance, in the case of AE and Je, we have observed the maximum coefficient (associated with lag time) as follows; maximum correlation coefficient; CCmax=0.846(5days), maximum mutual information; MImax=0.803(5days), maximum transfer entropy; TEmax=0.892(5days). Such dependency analysis can help to select the model parameters that influence the relativistic electrons fluxes and improve the existed models of the dynamical system.}

  abstract = {Abstract The solar wind-magnetosphere system is nonlinear. The solar wind drivers of geosynchronous electrons with energy range of 1.8–3.5 MeV are investigated using mutual information, conditional mutual information (CMI), and transfer entropy (TE). These information theoretical tools can establish linear and nonlinear relationships as well as information transfer. The information transfer from solar wind velocity (Vsw) to geosynchronous MeV electron flux (Je) peaks with a lag time of 2 days. As previously reported, Je is anticorrelated with solar wind density (nsw) with a lag of 1 day. However, this lag time and anticorrelation can be attributed at least partly to the Je(t + 2 days) correlation with Vsw(t) and nsw(t + 1 day) anticorrelation with Vsw(t). Analyses of solar wind driving of the magnetosphere need to consider the large lag times, up to 3 days, in the (Vsw, nsw) anticorrelation. Using CMI to remove the effects of Vsw, the response of Je to nsw is 30\% smaller and has a lag time < 24 h, suggesting that the MeV electron loss mechanism due to nsw or solar wind dynamic pressure has to start operating in < 24 h. nsw transfers about 36\% as much information as Vsw (the primary driver) to Je. Nonstationarity in the system dynamics is investigated using windowed TE. When the data are ordered according to transfer entropy value, it is possible to understand details of the triangle distribution that has been identified between Je(t + 2 days) versus Vsw(t).},

We present a collection of bouncing microbursts observed by the HILT instrument on SAMPEX from 1994 to 2004. We analyze the locations of the bouncing microbursts in L and MLT and find they align well with the properties of relativistic microbursts as a whole. We find that the majority of bouncing microbursts observed by SAMPEX have scale sizes of ∼30 km at the point of observation, or ∼300 km when mapped to the magnetic equator. The time separation between the peaks of these bouncing microbursts is usually either half a bounce period or a whole bounce period.},

  abstract = {A previously proposed model (Tsyganenko and Usmanov, 1982, Planet. Space Sci. 30, 985) is further developed, using IMP-A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and HEOS-1, -2 spacecraft measurements made during 1966–1980. The main improvement consists of a considerable extension of the modeling region by adding to the original data set a large number of magnetotail field measurements. Data points used in the present study cover a vast range of distances 4≲R≲70RE and comprise an unprecedentedly large number of measurements (a total of 36682 vector averages, almost twice as many as in our earlier data set). The data have been divided into groups corresponding to a sequence of Kp-index intervals, as well as different conditions in the solar wind. Mathematical representation of the magnetic field follows in its general features the approach developed in our earlier work, with some modifications. Two versions of the model are proposed, namely, (i) a “long” one with 26 parameters, valid up to distances ∼70RE, and (ii) a “truncated” one with 20 parameters and an applicability limit of ∼30RE.}
